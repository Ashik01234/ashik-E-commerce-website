This project runs on Node.js, using Express.js to manage routes - MySQL2 connects to the database, whereas bcrypt keeps passwords secure. Uploading files is handled by Multer; path deals with folder paths, yet EJS along with Bootstrap 5 builds flexible web pages. Information remains protected and organized thanks to MySQL.
